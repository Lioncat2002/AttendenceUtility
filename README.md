# attendenceUtility
 A small python script to find which students are absent
 
 ## Dependencies:
 - [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
 - python 3
 
## How does it work?
It takes in two ms excel sheet
- One containing the names and IDs of all the students enrolled in a class</br>

- on running the python script</br>
it checks for the missing students in the present student excel sheet</br>
and outputs their names and IDs accordingly</br>

- Here the 1st argument `test_fullStudents.xlsx` is the spreadsheet containing names and registration numbers </br>
of all students enrolled in a particular class
- The 2nd argument `test_student_perday.xlsx` is the spreadsheet containing the registration numbers</br>
of all the students present in a particular day

The 2nd spreadsheet can be generated by a **MS Teams Form or Google Form**

### Warning this is a very early prototype
While all the features work,</br>
it is not at all user friendly
